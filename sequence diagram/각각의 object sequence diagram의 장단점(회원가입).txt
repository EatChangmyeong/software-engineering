+ less responsibility for other objects
- lot of responsibility for other objects

(2) : 특징 : Objects communicate directly to each other
controller doesn't have lot of work
+ shortening communication chain
- concentrate responsibility to fewer objects(more work)

-> might cause trouble when revising or might be hard to
know the structure at once
- controller doesn't control the flow of events

(3) : 특징 : controller works with SignUpForm, AccountInfoValidator, UserDatabase and so on
+ object's responsibilities are fairly evenly distributed
